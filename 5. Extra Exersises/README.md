# After finishing the modules
After you have finished all the modules, you are free to spend time doing what you find interesting or especially challenging to improve. We recommend getting familiar with the Arduino IDE.

Spyder is a development environment designed for Python. Similarly, the Arduino IDE is a development environment designed for programming Arduino boards directly. The syntax is a little different, but the functions used here are the ones you are familiar with from the Arduino-Python3 library.

You can download the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Try to recreate some of the features you made with the Arduino-Python3 library, but now directly in the Arduino IDE.


## Exercises
- humidity sensor, using DHT function in the Arduino-Python3 library
- generate a live plot of data from the ultrasonic sensor
- research on the web/datasheets the protocol used by the temperature and humidity sensor and decode its messages manually on the oscilloscope.
- [set up an LCD display](Screen Display Tutorial.md) with temp/humidity sensor to make a mini weather station.
- measure, on the scope, (a) how quickly you can toggle a GPIO pin in a loop with the Arduino-Python3 library. Then (b) do it again inside in the Arduino IDE. As an advanced bonus, (c) read up in the ATMEGA-328P data sheet how to set a GPIO pin directly using a register write (instead of using the Arduino library digitalWrite function).
- play with servo motors - the EP project lab must have hundreds.
- in python, print an ASCII table - learn about chr() and ord() and ASCII encoding.
- learn how numbers are stored on computers: integer types, signed/unsigned - 2's complement. Floating point types.

## Extra Topics
- Python exception handling
- types and Python's weak type system
- funky python syntax (such as one line loops)
- Git/GitHub
- command line
